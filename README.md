### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/course-tracker.git
   cd course-tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Supabase**
   - Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Go to Settings > API to get your project URL and anon key
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root:
     ```env
     VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
     VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
     ```

4. **Configure Supabase Auth**
   - In your Supabase dashboard, go to Authentication > Settings
   - **Disable email confirmations** (set "Enable email confirmations" to OFF)
